# perlin-numpy

I wrote two articles on my blog about this project, the [first one](https://pvigier.github.io/2018/06/13/perlin-noise-numpy.html)  is about the generation of 2D noise while the [second one](https://pvigier.github.io/2018/11/02/3d-perlin-noise-numpy.html) is about the generation of 3D noise, feel free to read them!

## Description

A fast and simple perlin noise generator using numpy.

### 2D noise

The function `generate_perlin_noise_2d` generates a 2D texture of perlin noise. Its parameters are:

* `shape`: shape of the generated array (tuple of 2 ints)
* `res`: number of periods of noise to generate along each axis (tuple of 2 ints)
* `tileable`: if the noise should be tileable along each axis (tuple of 2 bools)

Note: `shape` must be a multiple of `res`

The function `generate_fractal_noise_2d` combines several octaves of 2D perlin noise to make 2D fractal noise. Its parameters are:

* `shape`: shape of the generated array (tuple of 2 ints)
* `res`: number of periods of noise to generate along each axis (tuple of 2 ints)
* `octaves`: number of octaves in the noise (int)
* `persistence`: scaling factor between two octaves (float)
* `lacunarity`: frequency factor between two octaves (float)
* `tileable`: if the noise should be tileable along each axis (tuple of 2 bools)

Note: `shape` must be a multiple of `lacunarity^(octaves-1)*res`


### 3D noise

The function `generate_perlin_noise_3d` generates a 3D texture of perlin noise. Its parameters are:

* `shape`: shape of the generated array (tuple of 3 ints)
* `res`: number of periods of noise to generate along each axis (tuple of 3 ints)
* `tileable`: if the noise should be tileable along each axis (tuple of 3 bools)

Note: `shape` must be a multiple of `res`

The function `generate_fractal_noise_2d` combines several octaves of 3D perlin noise to make 3D fractal noise. Its parameters are:

* `shape`: shape of the generated array (tuple of 3 ints)
* `res`: number of periods of noise to generate along each axis (tuple of 3 ints)
* `octaves`: number of octaves in the noise (int)
* `persistence`: scaling factor between two octaves (float)
* `lacunarity`: frequency factor between two octaves (float)
* `tileable`: if the noise should be tileable along each axis (tuple of 3 bools)

Note: `shape` must be a multiple of `lacunarity^(octaves-1)*res`
